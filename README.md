# Computer-Vision-Research-Papers

Computer vision is a vast field with numerous subtopics such as object detection, image segmentation, video analysis, or generative models.

Over a span of 60 days, the objective is to read and understand 30 research papers related to computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning, in order to expand knowledge and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field. 

  - *We will Look to cover well-known conferences and journals in the field of computer vision, such as CVPR (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), ICCV (International Conference on Computer Vision), or PAMI (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence).*
  
  - *We will be taking detailed notes and summarize the main contributions, methodologies, and results. This will help us retain the information and refer back to it later.*
  
  - [Discussion](): Discussions with fellow enthusiasts, researchers, or students who share similar interests. Attend conferences, join online forums or communities, and participate in relevant social media groups.
